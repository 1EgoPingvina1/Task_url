Design Patterns and Principles  
Repository Pattern: used to abstract the data access layer and provide a layer of abstraction between the business logic and the data storage 📂  
Dependency Injection: used to manage dependencies between components and make the application more modular and testable 💉  
Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): each component has a single responsibility and is designed to perform a specific task 📝  
Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY): code is written in a way that minimizes duplication and makes maintenance easier 📊  
Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern: used to separate concerns and provide a clear structure for the application 📈
